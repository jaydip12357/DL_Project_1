"""
build_features.py — Feature engineering pipeline.

Reads raw chest X-ray images from data/raw/chest_xray/ and writes
processed feature representations to data/processed/.

For this project the deep learning model (ResNet/ViT) learns features
end-to-end, so this script provides a HOG-based classical feature
extraction pipeline as a reference / baseline.
